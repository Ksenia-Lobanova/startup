		<h2>Who are we?</h2> 
		<p>
		We know that we live in the world where people are supposed to fit clothes. We also know that well-fitting, tailored clothes are expensive. But it doesn't have to be that way. That is why at Perfect Fit we upcycle preloved jeans to tailor them according to your measurements and they come at only a fraction of the usual cost!
